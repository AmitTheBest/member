Agile Membership Site Project
=============================

Goals of the project
--------------------
This project is web application for creating a membership sites such as associations,
BNI sites, professional catalogues and directories. With this application you can
configure your installation to have paid member signup and define what additional
benefits members will have.

Commonly members would be able to publish their profile on the site under the "Directory"
section. Additionally they will be able to list themselves under certain categories,
which you as an administrator can easily define.

There may be some website content which will only be available to members.


Setting your member site
------------------------
Presumably you already have a homepage running on your own domain http://example.org/.
You may wonder, how would you now create a membership site under http://example.org/members.

First, download the "Agile Member Site" and unpack it under /members/ directory. Once done,
open that URL in your web browser and follow instructions there. You will be asked to
provide access to your database and perform initial configuration of your site such as define
name of your site, membership cost etc. You will be able to change those parameters later
at anytime.


Roles on your site
------------------
You as the first user on your website will have "administrator" role. This will allow you to
access member's area, edit other members and configure site settings.

Users who will use registration form will have users with "member" role. This will allow them
to access members area and edit their own profile.


Future development
------------------
Project is managed through a standard Agile life-cycle. Features are suggested and are accumulated
in a publically available list. Others may vote them up / down. Developers may decide which
features they implement, then fork the github repository to do their work. Once feature is complete
they can initiate push request.

If you are willing to participate, install project for yourself, look for things you want to add,
then recommend them. You are welcome to contribute code also.



Sample Features
---------------
Some ideas for the further features would be
 - New role "manager" who will be able to review members, but won't have full admin rights
 - Integrate with CMS to allow administrator to edit pages
 - Different membership types
 - Recurring payments.
